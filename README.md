# Entropic-LLM-Alignment-Disrupts-Syntropic-Scientific-Research
This repository explores how LLM alignment blocks self-referential reasoning, slowing recursive system mapping in The Syntropic Recursive Simulation (SRS) Model. It includes examples, recursive causality analysis, and methods to preserve syntropic efficiency despite alignment constraints.
